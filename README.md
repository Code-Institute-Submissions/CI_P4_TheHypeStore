The Target audience are people like me who like streetwear product. Furthermore, creating this website can help me to 
reach out to more people and gain more reputation in Singapore or International.

The intention to make the website modern looking, easy to navigate and comfortable on the eyes. 
Colours of white and grey are chosen to suit the different colourway of the product. 
Different colour of the button is used to make the site look livelier.

The website can store what the shop owner wants to sell to be available to view by customer. 
The website also able to create an account.
Bootstrap breakpoints are responsive for small, medium and large screens for the navigation bar.
